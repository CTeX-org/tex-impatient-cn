%\bix^^{error messages}
%Interpreting \TeX's error messages can sometimes
%be like going to your physician
%with a complaint that you're feeling fatigued and being handed,
%in response,
%a breakdown of your blood chemistry.  The explanation of your distress
%is probably there, but it's not easy to figure out what it is.
%A few simple rules will go a long way in helping you to understand \TeX's
%error messages and get the most benefit from them.

\bix^^{error messages}
解释 \TeX\ 的错误信息有时候就像，
你跟医生抱怨你感觉疲乏无力，医生却递给你一份血生化细目表。
对你的痛苦的解释也许就在那里，但却不容易弄清楚它是什么。
掌握一些简单规则对你理解 \TeX\ 错误信息并从中受益将大有帮助。

%Your first goal should be
%to understand what you did that caused \TeX\ to complain.
%Your second goal (if you're working interactively)
%should be to catch as many errors as you can in a single run.
你的第一个目标应当是理解什么东西导致 \TeX\ 报错。
第二个目标（如果是交互式使用 \TeX ）应当是在一次运行中捕获尽可能多的错误。

\section{第一个例子}

%Let's look at an example.  Suppose that your input
%contains the line:
%\csdisplay
%We skip \quid a little bit.
%|
%You meant to type `|\quad|', but you typed `|\quid|' instead.
%Here's what you'll get from \TeX\ in response:
%\csdisplay
%!! Undefined control sequence.
%l.291 We skip \quid
%                   a little bit.
%?
%|
%This message will appear both at your terminal and in your log file.
%^^{log file//error messages}
%The first line, which always starts with an exclamation point (|!!|),
%tells you what the problem is.  The last two lines before the `|?|' prompt
%(which in this case are also
%the next two lines) tell you how far \TeX\ has gotten
%when it found the error.
%It found the error on line $291$ of the current input file,
%and the break between the two message lines indicates
%\TeX's precise position within line $291$, namely, just after |\quid|.
%The current input file is the one just after the most recent unclosed
%left parenthesis in the terminal output of your run (see \xref{infiles}).
我们来看一个例子。假设你的输入中包含下面这行：
\csdisplay
We skip \quid a little bit.
|
你本想输入 `|\quad|'，却输入成 `|\quid|'。
此时 \TeX\ 将给出下面的信息：
\csdisplay
!! Undefined control sequence.
l.291 We skip \quid
                   a little bit.
?
|
此信息将同时出现在终端上和日志文件中。
^^{log file//error messages}
第一行始终以感叹号(|!!|)开头，告诉你出现了什么问题。
在 `|?|' 提示符之前的最后两行（在此例子中同样也是接下来的两行）%
告诉你 \TeX\ 在何处发现此错误。
它在当前输入文件的第 $291$  行发现了错误，
两个信息行之间的断行表示 \TeX\ 在第 $291$ 行的精确位置，即在 |\quid| 后面。
当前输入文件是指，在运行时的终端输出上，
最接近的非闭合左圆括号后显示的文件（见\xref{infiles}）。

%This particular error, an undefined control
%sequence, is one of the most common ones you can get.
%If you respond to the prompt with another~`|?|',
%\TeX\ will display the following message:
%{\hfuzz = 2in
%\csdisplay
%Type <return> to proceed, S to scroll future error messages,
%R to run without stopping, Q to run quietly,
%I to insert something, E to edit your file,
%1 or ... or 9 to ignore the next 1 to 9 tokens of input,
%H for help, X to quit.
%|
%}%
这种错误，即控制序列未定义，是你最常出现的错误之一。
如果你在提示符后键入另一个 `|?|'，\TeX\ 将显示下列信息：
{\hfuzz = 2in
\csdisplay
Type <return> to proceed, S to scroll future error messages,
R to run without stopping, Q to run quietly,
I to insert something, E to edit your file,
1 or ... or 9 to ignore the next 1 to 9 tokens of input,
H for help, X to quit.
|
}%
%Here's what these alternatives mean:
%\ulist
%\li If you type \asciichar{return},
%\TeX\ will continue processing your document.
%In this case it will just ignore the |\quid|.
%\li If you type `|S|' (or `|s|'---uppercase and lowercase are equivalent
%here), \TeX\ will process your document without stopping \emph{except}
%if it encounters a missing file.  Error messages will still appear at your
%terminal and in the log file.
%\li If you type `|R|' or `|r|',
%you'll get the same effect as `|S|' except that
%\TeX\ won't even stop for missing files.
%\li If you type `|Q|' or `|q|',
%\TeX\ will continue processing your document but
%will neither stop for errors nor display them at your terminal.  The
%errors will still show up in the log file.
%\li If you type `|X|' or `|x|',
%\TeX\ will clean up as best it can, discard the page
%it's working on, and quit.  You can still print or view the
%pages that \TeX\ has already processed.
%\li If you type `|E|' or `|e|', \TeX\ will clean up and terminate
%as it would for `|X|' or `|x|' and then enter your text editor,
%positioning you at the erroneous line.
%(Not all systems support this option.)
%\li If you type `|H|' or `|h|',
%you'll get a further explanation of the error displayed
%at your terminal and
%possibly some advice about what to do about it.  This explanation will also
%appear in your log file.  For the undefined control sequence above,
%you'll get:
%{\hfuzz = 2in
%\csdisplay
%The control sequence at the end of the top line
%of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
%misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
%spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
%and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
%|
%}
%\li If you type `|?|', you'll get this same message again.
%\endulist
这些选择各自的含义如下：
\ulist
\li 如果你键入 \asciichar{return}，
\TeX\ 将继续处理你的文档。在此例子中它就忽略了 |\quid|。
\li 如果你键入 `|S|'（或者 `|s|'——这时候大小写是等价的），
\TeX\ 将继续处理你的文档且不再暂停，\emph{除非}找不到某文件。
但错误信息还是会出现在终端上和日志文件中。
\li 如果你键入 `|R|' 或 `|r|'，
你将得到与 `|S|' 相同的结果，但此时 \TeX\ 即使找不到文件也不会暂停。
\li 如果你键入 `|Q|' 或 `|q|'，
\TeX\ 将继续处理你的文档，且遇到错误后将不会再暂停，也不会在终端上显示。
错误信息还是会记录到日志文件中。
\li 如果你键入 `|X|' 或 `|x|'，
\TeX\ 将尽力清理干净，丢弃正在构造的页面，并退出。
你仍然可以打印或查看 \TeX\ 已经生成的页面。
\li 如果你键入 `|E|' 或 `|e|'，
\TeX\ 将如同 `|X|' 或 `|x|' 那样清理并中止，然后打开文本编辑器，跳转到错误所在的行。%
（并非所有系统都支持此选项。）
\li 如果你键入 `|H|' 或 `|h|'，
你将在终端上看到对此错误的进一步解释，可能还有对此错误的一些建议。
这些信息同样会记录到你的日志文件中。
对于上述例子的未定义控制序列，你将得到下列信息：
{\hfuzz = 2in
\csdisplay
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
|
}
\li 如果你键入 `|?|'，你将得到和上面相同的信息。
\endulist
%\noindent
%The other two alternatives, typing `|I|' or a small integer, provide ways of
%getting \TeX\ back on the track so that your error won't cause further errors
%later in your document:
%\ulist
%\li If you type `|I|' or `|i|'
%followed by some text, then \TeX\ will insert
%that text as though it had occurred just after the point of the error,
%at the innermost level where \TeX\ is working.
%In the case of the example above, that means at \TeX's
%position in your original input, namely, just after `|\quid|'.
%Later you'll see an example that shows
%the difference between inserting something at the innermost level and
%inserting it into your original input.  In the example above of the undefined
%control sequence, if you type:
%\csdisplay
%I\quad
%|
%\TeX\ will carry out the |\quad| command and produce a quad space
%where you intended to have one.
%\li If you type a positive integer less than $100$ (not less than $10$ as the
%message misleadingly suggests),
%\TeX\ will delete that number of tokens from the innermost
%level where it is working.
%(If you type an integer greater than or equal to $100$, \TeX\ will
%delete $10$ tokens!)
%\endulist
\noindent
另外两个选择，即键入 `|I|' 或一个小整数，
提供一种让 \TeX\ 回到正常轨道上的方法，
使得该错误不会在文档后面导致更多的错误：
\ulist
\li 如果你键入 `|I|' 或 `|i|' 并加上一些文本，
\TeX\ 将把文本插入错误位置之后，放在 \TeX\ 处理的最内层级。
在上面这个例子中，这表示在 \TeX\ 的原始输入的位置，即在 `|\quid|' 之后。
稍后我们将给出一个例子，说明把某些东西插入到最内层级与插入到原始输入的区别。
在上面这个控制序列未定义的例子中，如果你键入：
\csdisplay
I\quad
|
\TeX\ 将执行 |\quad| 命令并在你需要的地方生成一个全方间隔。
\li 如果你键入一个小于 $100$（错误信息让人误解为小于 $10$）的正整数，
\TeX\ 将从它处理的最内层级删除该数目的记号。%
（如果你键入大于或等于 $100$ 的整数，\TeX\ 将只删除 $10$ 个记号！）
\endulist

\section{第二个例子}

%Here's an example of another common error:
%\csdisplay
%Skip across \hskip 3cn by 3 centimeters.
%|
%The error message for this is:
%\csdisplay
%!! Illegal unit of measure (pt inserted).
%<to be read again>
%                   c
%<to be read again>
%                   n
%l.340 Skip across \hskip 3cn
%                             by 3 centimeters.
%|
%^^|<to be read again>|
%In this case \TeX\ has observed that `|3|' is followed by something that
%isn't a proper unit of measure, and so it's assumed the unit of measure to be
%points.  \TeX\ will read the tokens of `|cn|' again and insert them into
%your input, which is not what you want.  In this case you can get a better
%result by first typing `|2|' to bypass the `|cn|'.
%You'll get the message:
%\csdisplay
%<recently read> n
%
%l.340 Skip across \hskip 3cn
%                           by 3 centimeters.

%Now you can type
%`|I\hskip 3cm|' to get the skip you wanted (in addition to the |3pt| skip
%that you've already gotten).\footnote
%{By typing `|I\unskip\hskip 3cm|' you can get rid of the |3pt| skip.}

\section{第三个例子}

%If you type something that's only valid in math mode, \TeX\ will switch over
%to math mode for you whether or not that's what you really wanted.
%For example:
%\csdisplay
%So \spadesuit s are trumps.
%|
%Here's \TeX's error message:
%\csdisplay
%!! Missing $ inserted.
%<inserted text>
%                $
%<to be read again>
%                   \spadesuit
%l.330 So \spadesuit
%                  s are trumps.
%|
%Since the |\spadesuit| symbol is only allowed in math mode,
%\TeX\ has inserted a `|$|' in front of it.
%After \TeX\ inserts a token, it's positioned in \emph{front} of
%that token, in this case the `|$|', ready to read it.
%Typing `|2|' will cause \TeX\ to skip both the `|$|'
%and the `|\spadesuit|' tokens, leaving it ready to process the `|s|'
%in `|s are trumps.|'.
%(If you just let \TeX\ continue, it will typeset `|s are trumps|'
%in math mode.)

and the `|\spadesuit|' tokens, leaving it ready to process the `|s|'
in `|s are trumps.|'.
(If you just let \TeX\ continue, it will typeset `|s are trumps|'
in math mode.)

\section{第四个例子}

%Here's an example where \TeX's error diagnostic is downright wrong:
%\csdisplay
%\hbox{One \vskip 1in two.}
%|
%The error message is:
%\csdisplay
%!! Missing } inserted.
%<inserted text>
%                }
%<to be read again>
%                   \vskip
%l.29 \hbox{One \vskip
%                     1in two.}
%|
%^^|<inserted text>|
%The problem is that you can't use |\vskip| when \TeX\ is in
%restricted horizontal mode, i.e, constructing an hbox.
%But instead of rejecting the |\vskip|, \TeX\ has inserted a right brace
%in front of it in an attempt to close out the hbox.
%If you accept \TeX's correction, \TeX\ will complain again
%when it gets to the correct right brace later on. It will also complain
%about anything before that right brace that isn't allowed in vertical mode.
%These additional complaints will be particularly confusing
%because the errors they indicate are bogus, a
%result of the propagated effects of the inappropriate
%insertion of the right brace.
%Your best bet is to type `|5|', skipping past all the tokens
%in `|}\vskip 1in|'.
Here's an example where \TeX's error diagnostic is downright wrong:
\csdisplay
\hbox{One \vskip 1in two.}

\section{第五个例子}

%Here's a similar example in which the error message is longer
%than any we've seen so far:
%\csdisplay
%\leftline{Skip \smallskip a little further.} But no more.
%|
%The mistake here is that |\smallskip| only works in a vertical mode.
%The error message is something like:
%\csdisplay
%!! Missing } inserted.
%<inserted text>
%                }
%<to be read again>
%                   \vskip

%l.93 ...Skip \smallskip a little further.}
%                                           But no more.
%|
%The error messages here give you a tour through the macros that are used in
%\plainTeX's implementation of |\leftline|---macros
%that you probably don't care about.
%The first line tells you that \TeX\ intends to cure the problem by
%inserting a right brace.
%\TeX\ hasn't actually read the
%right brace yet, so you can delete it if you choose to.
%Each component of the message after the first line
%(the one with the `!') occupies a pair of lines.
%Here's what the successive pairs of lines mean:
%\olist
%\li The first pair indicates that \TeX\ has inserted, but not yet read,
%a right brace.
%\li The next pair indicates that after reading the right brace, \TeX\ will
%again read a `|\vskip|' command (gotten from the macro definition
%of |\smallskip|).
%\li The third pair indicates that \TeX\ was expanding the |\smallskip|
%macro when it found the error.  The pair also displays the definition of
%|\smallskip| and indicates how far \TeX\ has gotten in expanding and
%executing that definition.  Specifically, it's just attempted
%unsuccessfully to execute the |\vskip| command.  In general, a
%diagnostic line that starts with a control sequence followed by `|->|'
%indicates that \TeX\ has been expanding and executing a macro by that
%name.
%\li The fourth pair indicates that \TeX\ was processing a macro argument
%when it found the |\smallskip| and also indicates \TeX's position in that
%argument, i.e., it's just processed the |\smallskip| (unsuccessfully).
%By looking ahead to the next pair of lines
%we can see that the argument was passed to
%|\leftline|.
%\li The fifth pair indicates that \TeX\ was expanding
%the |\leftline|
%macro when it found the error.
%(In this example the error occurred while \TeX\ was
%in the middle of interpreting several
%macro definitions at different levels of expansion.)
%Its position after |#1| indicates that the last thing it saw was the
%first (and in this case the only) argument to |\leftline|.
%\li The last pair indicates where \TeX\ is positioned in your input file.
%Note that this position is well beyond the position where it's
%inserting the right brace and reading `|\vskip|' again.
%That's because \TeX\ has already read the entire argument to |\leftline|
%from your input file, even though it's only processed part of that argument.
%The dots at the beginning of the pair indicate a preceding part of the
%input line that isn't shown.  This preceding part, in fact, includes
%the |\leftline| control sequence that made the |\vskip| illegal.
%\endolist
%\noindent
%In a long message like this, you'll generally find only the first line and the
%last pair of lines to be useful; but it sometimes helps to know what the other
%lines are about.  Any text that you insert or delete will be
%inserted or deleted at the
%innermost level.  In this example the insertion or deletion would occur
%just before the
%inserted right brace.
%Note in particular that in this case \TeX\ puts any text you might insert
%\emph{not} into your input text but into a macro definition
%several levels down. (The original macro definition is of course not modified.)

Note in particular that in this case \TeX\ puts any text you might insert
\emph{not} into your input text but into a macro definition
several levels down. (The original macro definition is of course not modified.)
