Some random thoughts for people thinking of working with the source:

- See errata.future for some relatively small ideas for enhancements.

- You may want to translate the source into some more standard
format, such as Texinfo; we used many homegrown macros mostly to make
typing and markup easier.

- You may also want to redo the index creation to use makeindex or some
other standard program, instead of the homegrown Icon programs (or else
they need to be fixed; right now somehow the + characters used for
spaces in book.idx are preserved in book.sdx, which is wrong).  Until
the index can be easily regenerated, the page breaks can't change
without the index becoming useless.

- Printing the GFDL required many kludges, a true Eplain-compatible
version is needed (which in turn would require using the current eplain
to print the book).

Happy TeXing.
